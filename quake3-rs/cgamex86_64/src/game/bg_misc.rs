/*QUAKED item_***** ( 0 0 0 ) (-16 -16 -16) (16 16 16) suspended
DO NOT USE THIS CLASS, IT JUST HOLDS GENERAL INFORMATION.
The suspended flag will allow items to hang in the air, otherwise they are dropped to the next surface.

If an item is the target of another entity, it will not spawn in until fired.

An item fires all of its targets when it is picked up.  If the toucher can't carry it, the targets won't be fired.

"notfree" if set to 1, don't spawn in free for all games
"notteam" if set to 1, don't spawn in team games
"notsingle" if set to 1, don't spawn in single player games
"wait"	override the default wait before respawning.  -1 = never respawn automatically, which can be used with targeted spawning.
"random" random number of plus or minus seconds varied from the respawn time
"count" override quantity or duration on most items.
