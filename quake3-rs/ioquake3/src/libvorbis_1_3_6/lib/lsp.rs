 function: LSP (also called LSF) conversion routines

 The LSP generation code is taken (with minimal modification and a
 few bugfixes) from "On the Computation of the LSP Frequencies" by
 Joseph Rothweiler (see http://www.rothweiler.us for contact info).
 The paper is available at:

 http://www.myown1.com/joe/lsf

********************************************************************/
/* Note that the lpc-lsp conversion finds the roots of polynomial with
an iterative root polisher (CACM algorithm 283).  It *is* possible
to confuse this algorithm into not converging; that should only
happen with absurdly closely spaced roots (very sharp peaks in the
LPC f response) which in turn should be impossible in our use of
the code.  If this *does* happen anyway, it's a bug in the floor
finder; find the cause of the confusion (probably a single bin
spike or accidental near-float-limit resolution problems) and
correct it. */
/* three possible LSP to f curve functions; the exact computation
(float), a lookup based float implementation, and an integer
implementation.  The float lookup is likely the optimal choice on
any machine with an FPU.  The integer implementation is *not* fixed
point (due to the need for a large dynamic range and thus a
separately tracked exponent) and thus much more complex than the
relatively simple float implementations. It's mostly for future
work on a fully fixed point implementation for processors like the
ARM family. */
/* define either of these (preferably FLOAT_LOOKUP) to have faster
but less precise implementation. */
/* old, nonoptimized but simple version for any poor sap who needs to
figure out what the hell this code does, or wants the other
fraction of a dB precision */
/* side effect: changes *lsp to cosines of lsp */
