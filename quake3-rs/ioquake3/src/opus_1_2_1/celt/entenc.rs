If there is a potential to propagate a carry over several symbols, they are
 buffered until it can be determined whether or not an actual carry will
 occur.
If the counter for the buffered symbols overflows, then the stream becomes
 undecodable.
This gives a theoretical limit of a few billion symbols in a single packet on
 32-bit systems.
The alternative is to truncate the range in order to force a carry, but
 requires similar carry tracking in the decoder, needlessly slowing it down.*/

/*Initializes the encoder.

/*Encodes a symbol given its frequency information.
The frequency information must be discernable by the decoder, assuming it
 has read only the previous symbols from the stream.
It is allowable to change the frequency information, or even the entire
 source alphabet, so long as the decoder can tell from the context of the
 previously encoded information that it is supposed to do so as well.
_fl: The cumulative frequency of all symbols that come before the one to be
      encoded.
_fh: The cumulative frequency of all symbols up to and including the one to
      be encoded.
     Together with _fl, this defines the range [_fl,_fh) in which the
      decoded value will fall.
_ft: The sum of the frequencies of all the symbols*/

/*Encodes a symbol given an "inverse" CDF table.
_s:    The index of the symbol to encode.
_icdf: The "inverse" CDF, such that symbol _s falls in the range
        [_s>0?ft-_icdf[_s-1]:0,ft-_icdf[_s]), where ft=1<<_ftb.
       The values must be monotonically non-increasing, and the last value
        must be 0.
_ftb: The number of bits of precision in the cumulative distribution.*/
/*Encodes a raw unsigned integer in the stream.
_fl: The integer to encode.

/*Overwrites a few bits at the very start of an existing stream, after they
 have already been encoded.
This makes it possible to have a few flags up front, where it is easy for
 decoders to access them without parsing the whole stream, even if their
 values are not determined until late in the encoding process, without having
 to buffer all the intermediate symbols in the encoder.
In order for this to work, at least _nbits bits must have already been
 encoded using probabilities that are an exact power of two.
The encoder can verify the number of encoded bits is sufficient, but cannot
 check this latter condition.
_val:   The bits to encode (in the least _nbits significant bits).
        They will be decoded in order from most-significant to least.
_nbits: The number of bits to overwrite.
        This must be no more than 8.*/
/*Compacts the data to fit in the target size.
This moves up the raw bits at the end of the current buffer so they are at
 the end of the new buffer size.
The caller must ensure that the amount of data that's already been written
 will fit in the new size.
_size: The number of bytes in the new buffer.
       This must be large enough to contain the bits already written, and
        must be no larger than the existing size.*/
