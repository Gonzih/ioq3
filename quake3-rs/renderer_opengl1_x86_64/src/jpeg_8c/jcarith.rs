/* NOTE: Uncomment the following #define if you want to use the
 * given formula for calculating the AC conditioning parameter Kx
 * for spectral selection progressive coding in section G.1.3.2
 * of the spec (Kx = Kmin + SRL (8 + Se - Kmin) 4).
 * Although the spec and P&M authors claim that this "has proven
 * to give good results for 8 bit precision samples", I'm not
 * convinced yet that this is really beneficial.
 * Early tests gave only very marginal compression enhancements
 * (a few - around 5 or so - bytes even for very large files),
 * which would turn out rather negative if we'd suppress the
 * DAC (Define Arithmetic Conditioning) marker segments for
 * the default parameters in the future.
 * Note that currently the marker writing module emits 12-byte
 * DAC segments for a full-component scan in a color image.
 * This is not worth worrying about IMHO. However, since the
 * spec defines the default values to be used if the tables
 * are omitted (unlike Huffman tables, which are required
 * anyway), one might optimize this behaviour in the future,
 * and then it would be disadvantageous to use custom tables if
 * they don't provide sufficient gain to exceed the DAC size.
 *
 * On the other hand, I'd consider it as a reasonable result
 * that the conditioning has no significant influence on the
 * compression performance. This means that the basic
 * statistical model is already rather stable.
 *
 * Thus, at the moment, we use the default conditioning values
 * anyway, and do not use the custom formula.
