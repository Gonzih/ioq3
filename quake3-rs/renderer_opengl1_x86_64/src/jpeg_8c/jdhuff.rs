 * Fetching the next N bits from the input stream is a time-critical operation
 * for the Huffman decoders.  We implement it with a combination of inline
 * macros and out-of-line subroutines.  Note that N (the number of bits
 * demanded at one time) never exceeds 15 for JPEG use.
 *
 * We read source bytes into get_buffer and dole out bits as needed.
 * If get_buffer already contains enough bits, they are fetched in-line
 * by the macros CHECK_BIT_BUFFER and GET_BITS.  When there aren't enough
 * bits, jpeg_fill_bit_buffer is called; it will attempt to fill get_buffer
 * as full as possible (not just to the number of bits needed; this
 * prefetching reduces the overhead cost of calling jpeg_fill_bit_buffer).
 * Note that jpeg_fill_bit_buffer may return FALSE to indicate suspension.
 * On TRUE return, jpeg_fill_bit_buffer guarantees that get_buffer contains
 * at least the requested number of bits --- dummy zeroes are inserted if
 * necessary.
